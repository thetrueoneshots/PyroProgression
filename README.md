INSTALLING

Download CubeModLoader.fip from https://github.com/thetrueoneshots/Cube-World-Mod-Launcher/releases and place it in your Cube World folder (should be Steam\steamapps\common\Cube World). Make a folder called "mods" (without quotes) in your Cube World folder and put `.dll` found in this repository's release in that mods folder.
